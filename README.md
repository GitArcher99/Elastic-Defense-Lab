Elastic-Defense-Lab: SOC Analyst Home Lab

Overview
Elastic-Defense-Lab is a cybersecurity home lab that simulates real-world SOC analyst tasks using AWS, Windows, Elastic SIEM, and Elastic Defend. It provides hands-on experience in threat detection, monitoring, and incident response.

Tools & Technologies

AWS EC2 â€“ Windows instance for endpoint monitoring
Elastic SIEM â€“ Cloud-based security analytics
Elastic Defend â€“ Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
Windows Event Logs â€“ Log collection for analysis
PowerShell â€“ Agent installation & configuration
Key Features
âœ” Deploys a Windows VM in AWS
âœ” Installs Elastic Defend for endpoint security
âœ” Configures Elastic SIEM for log collection & analysis
âœ” Simulates malware detection using the EICAR test file
âœ” Enables hands-on SOC workflows like alert triage

Setup Steps

Deploy AWS Windows Instance â€“ Set up an EC2 instance, configure security groups, and connect via RDP.
Set Up Elastic SIEM â€“ Deploy an Elastic Cloud instance, enable security analytics, and configure log ingestion.
Install Elastic Defend â€“ Add and install the Elastic Defend agent on the VM to monitor security events.
Simulate Malware Detection â€“ Run the EICAR test file to trigger an alert and review it in Elastic SIEM.
Learning Outcomes
âœ… Understand SIEM architecture & log ingestion
âœ… Gain hands-on experience with malware detection & response
âœ… Configure endpoint security tools & analyze alerts

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Automate deployment with Terraform
ðŸ”¹ Expand to Linux/macOS monitoring
ðŸ”¹ Develop custom detection rules & integrate other SIEM tools
